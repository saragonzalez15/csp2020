     <p> In this project, we culminated all the knowledge we learned throughout the unit 1.1. Our project displays a scene that consists of multiple flowers, a bee, and a beehive. We created these components by finding images online and creating them into GIFs in order to import them into Python Turtle. The flower was created using a for loop in order to shorten the process of importing and positioning six different flowers. In order to get the bee to move we used a while loop that will repeat six times. This allows the bee to fly from the hive, down to all the flowers, and collect the honey to then bring back up to the hive. </p>

    <p> In this project, we utilized all the programming skills we learned in the unit 1.2 to create a game similar to Pac-Man. We used GIFs for the shark, the fishes, and the underwater background. We coded the shark's movement so that the user could move the shark using the computer's arrow keys. The maze's walls, barriers, and the fishes were coded to be placed randomly each time the game is loaded. Everytime the shark eats a fish, the score increments by 1. If the shark runs into the wall it flips over, dies, and the game is over. However, if you are able to eat all ten fish, the game ends and the screen displays a message of "You Win".</p>

    <p>In this project, we used the same programming skills learned in 1.2 and our previous project to create a different game. We imported GIFs for the background, zombies, and peashooter. Then we used the preexsisting circle turtle as a pea. We set up both a score and timer that lets the game run for 30 seconds. Everytime a pea hits a zombie, the score increases by 1. The goal of the game is to kill as many zombies in the given 30 seconds. Once the time runs out "End Game" displays in the middle of the screen and you can no longer move or shoot the pea.</p>

    <p>For this project, we used Scratch to create the game rock paper scissors. The opponent's hand randomly generates a shape each time the game is run. The user can pick between pressing 'r' for rock, 's' for scissors, or 'p' for paper. Depending on the score and whether you win, lose or tie, the background will change to display "You Lose", "You Win", or "Tie". We imported images from Google and turned them into sprites for the different hand gestures.</p>
