     <p> In this project, we culminated all the knowledge we learned throughout the unit 1.1. Our project displays a scene that consists of multiple flowers, a bee, and a beehive. We created these components by finding images online and creating them into GIFs in order to import them into Python Turtle. The flower was created using a for loop in order to shorten the process of importing and positioning six different flowers. In order to get the bee to move we used a while loop that will repeat six times. This allows the bee to fly from the hive, down to all the flowers, and collect the honey to then bring back up to the hive. </p>
